# This is My Search

Every Librarian has a favorite search. What's yours?

### About

At the closing reception for the [Library Technology Conference 2014](http://libtechconf.org), I had a great conversation with colleagues [John Chapman](http://twitter.com/johnwchapman), [Cody Hanson](http://codyhanson.com), Chris Schommer, and Ben Durrant about how we all have a particular search we like to do when testing out a new search tool. Mine is "batman," and a colleague of mine likes "Stress in the Workplace." John's was "[Space Law](http://thisismysearch.com/?q=space+law)," which was interesting. We agreed that the world needed a social network for librarians to help them share their favorite searches.

And so [thisismysearch.com](http://thisismysearch.com) was born.

That night at the hotel, Cynthia Ng and I built [thisismysearch.com](http://thisismysearch.com) while sitting at the bar. The goal was to get folks trying their searches in different search tools, and sharing the results. The site took us about 5 hours to build, but should probably have only taken about 30 minutes.

### How to Contribute

If you know how to code, you can look at the [issues and features list](https://github.com/mreidsma/thisismysearch/issues), and find something to work on. [Fork the repository](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo) and once you're satisfied with your fix, submit a pull request.

If you don't know how to code, you can [submit your library's search URLs](http://twitter.com/?status=%40ThisIsMySearch%20Please%20add%20my%20library%20to%20your%20silly%20website.%20Our%20URL%20is%3A) or [do some searches](http://thisismysearch.com) and share them with others.
